## Description
Checkyourself allows you to log your mood and location and recommend activities to go with your mood! 

## Installation 
Clone the repo and open the index.html in your browser OR click Here to use the deployed version.

## Usage
On the landing page, choose what state you are in. Once this is selected, you will have the option to log some notes about your mood as well as give it a score from 1-5 (1 being poor mood, 5 being an excellent mood). Once this is saved it will be moved into a card where you can click 'see suggestions' and on the right you should see some activities in your area to go with your mood. The Application also uses local storage so if you close the link and re-open it you should still see your previous moods.
